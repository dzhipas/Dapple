         <title>Dapple 1.0.8 Released</title>
         <description>
            Dapple 1.0.8 has been released.  This release provides a couple of bug fixes and new features. Most notable is an enhancement to the server tree inside Dapple to give better visual feedback and un-clutter the tree view when browsing very large catalogs. With this change Dapple can scale to 100's of thousands of layers in this view without encumbering the interface.
